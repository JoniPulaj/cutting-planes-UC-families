# cutting-planes-UC-families
A cutting plane method for Poonen's Theorem implemented in python that makes use of commercial integer programming software (CPLEX) and open source integer programming software (SCIP). Output can be checked separately with exact rational programming software http://scip.zib.de/#exact and VIPR https://github.com/ambros-gleixner/VIPR. 
User will need Cplex (available for free for academics), Scip (available for free) and finally igraph (available for free) for finding isomorphic families of sets.
